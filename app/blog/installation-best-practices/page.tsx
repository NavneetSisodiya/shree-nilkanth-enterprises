        <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          HDPE (High-Density Polyethylene) pipes offer outstanding resistance to corrosion, flexibility, and long-term durability. These characteristics make them ideal for drip and sprinkler irrigation systems in modern agriculture. By replacing traditional piping systems, farmers benefit from fewer leaks, reduced maintenance, and optimized water distribution.
